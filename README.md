# Souper Secret Settings
Re-adds the old super secret settings through the power of soup!

Simply drink a beetroot soup to activate a random souper secret setting, then drink milk or relog to clear it

You can use multiple souper secret settings at once using `/soup:stack`, and optifine/iris shaderpacks are compatible, so you can get some pretty cool looking combinations - personally i found that using [Epoch](https://modrinth.com/shader/epoch) as a base can look really cool.

Souper secret settings also expands on vanillas super secret settings by adding some custom ones, have fun eating soup!

## Commands
In the likely case you do not have access to beetroot soup, you can use a range of commands, all starting with `/soup:` to control the souper secret settings.

`/soup:random` - Randomise shader, same as drinking soup

`/soup:clear` - Reset shader to default, same as drinking milk

`/soup:set <x>` - Set to specific shader \<x>, with a suggested list of all the shaders.

`/soup:stack add <x>` - Stacks the specified shader, so you can have multiple souper secret settings active at once

`/soup:stack random` - Adds a random shader to the stack

`/soup:stack undo` - Remove the topmost shader in the stack

`/soup:query` - Get the names of the currently active shaders

The list of available shaders, including the custom ones can be seen [Here](SuperSecretSettingsList.md)

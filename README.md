# Souper Secret Settings
Re-adds the old super secret settings through the power of soup!

Simply drink a beetroot soup to activate a random souper secret setting, then drink milk or relog to clear it

### Commands
In the probably likely case you do not have access to beetroot soup, you can use a range of commands, all starting with `/soup:` to control the souper secret settings.

`/soup:random` - Randomise shader, same as drinking soup

`/soup:clear` - Reset shader to default, same as drinking milk

`/soup:set <x>` - Set to specific shader \<x>, with a suggested list of all the shaders.

`/soup:query` - Get the name of the current shader

### Optifine/Iris Shaders
Souper secret settings are applied after shaderpacks, so you can get some cool looking screenshots if you use stylised shaderpacks to begin with (personally i found https://modrinth.com/shader/epoch can look really cool)
